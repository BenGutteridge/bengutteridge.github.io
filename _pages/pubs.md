### [Oxford Pub Guide: A Primer](/pubs/background)
-->

As of January 2022, my friend Rob and I have, over the course of our time spent as students, been to 90 of the 98 pubs within the Oxford ringroad. 
We've attempted to rate every single pub on a 5-star scale, as well as provide other useful information.

Pubs are assessed on a number of traits, primarily range and quality of drinks, decor, and ambience. 
Some may have unique features that set them apart, such as historical significance, great food or a stellar beer garden (some of these are marked with 'USP' in the table). 

The ideal pub will be attractive inside and out, and will have a pleasant ambience conducive to a good time with friends, a wide and rotating range of real ales, and if you're feeling especially greedy, a fireplace.

The table below is sortable and searchable, and includes some features such as food, seating etc. (e.g. search 'beer garden'). 
It is a work-in-progress and we hope to continue updating it regularly. Pubs not yet visited are marked with 'n/a'.

(The table can be a little temperamental on mobile; it can be accessed directly, and less problematically, [here](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbyV1Fi0N1cTI4DJv20MrNndW-sXVUuYOTcXBEO8WW0e1eu2WKNiYFQ-2Grnldn-s3ACbw/exec).)
