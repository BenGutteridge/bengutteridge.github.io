I am a first-year DPhil candidate in the Machine Learning Research Group at the University of Oxford, and a member of the Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems Centre 
for Doctoral Training ([AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/)). 

My broad research interests are inductive biases in machine learning, and probabilistic ML, including ML on 
graphs, geometric deep learning, Bayesian physics-informed neural networks, and latent force models, as well as Gaussian processes, Bayesian deep learning, variational inference 
and probabilistic numerics (Bayesian optimisation/quadrature). 

I am a member of the [HumBug](https://humbug.ox.ac.uk/) project, which uses deep learning to detect and identify mosquito species by their 
flight tone using budget smartphones. I completed my MEng in Engineering Science, specialising in information engineering, at the University of 
Oxford, and was supervised by Prof. Michael Osborne in my fourth-year project.
