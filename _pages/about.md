I am a second-year DPhil candidate in the Machine Learning Research Group at the University of Oxford, and a member of the Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems Centre
for Doctoral Training ([AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/)).

My broad research interest is in inductive biases, particularly in geometric deep learning and graph neural networks.
I'm also interested in reinforcement learning, dynamics, ML for finance, and probabilistic methods, including Bayesian deep learning, Gaussian processes, variational inference and probabilistic numerics (Bayesian optimisation/quadrature).

I previously worked on the [HumBug](https://humbug.ox.ac.uk/) project, which uses deep learning to detect and identify mosquito species by their
flight tone using budget smartphones. I completed my MEng in Engineering Science, specialising in information engineering, at the University of
Oxford, and was supervised by Prof. Michael Osborne in my fourth-year project.

In my spare time I enjoy reading, playing D&D, and exploring new pubs, especially those with real ale.
I maintain a table of ratings and useful information about every pub in Oxford [here](/pubs/).
