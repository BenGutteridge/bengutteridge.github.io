I am a first-year DPhil candidate in the Machine Learning Research Group at the University of Oxford, and a member of the Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems Centre 
for Doctoral Training ([AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/)). 

My broad research interests are in deep learning, reinforcement learning, and inductive biases, particularly through geometric deep learning/graph ML or physics/dynamics.
I'm also interested in probabilistic methods including Bayesian deep learning, Gaussian processes, variational inference and probabilistic numerics (Bayesian optimisation/quadrature).

I am a member of the [HumBug](https://humbug.ox.ac.uk/) project, which uses deep learning to detect and identify mosquito species by their 
flight tone using budget smartphones. I completed my MEng in Engineering Science, specialising in information engineering, at the University of 
Oxford, and was supervised by Prof. Michael Osborne in my fourth-year project.

In my spare time I enjoy reading, playing D&D, and exploring new pubs, especially those with real ale.
I maintain a table of ratings and useful information about every pub in Oxford [here](/pubs/).
