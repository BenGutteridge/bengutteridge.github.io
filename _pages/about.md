I am a fourth-year DPhil student in the Machine Learning Research Group at the University of Oxford, and a member of the Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems Centre for Doctoral Training ([AIMS CDT](https://aims.robots.ox.ac.uk/)). 
I am supervised by Xiaowen Dong and Michael Bronstein.

My research interests include:
- Graph neural networks (message passing NNs and graph Transformers), particularly long-range interactions and the over-smoothing and -squashing problems
- LLMs, particularly in-context learning and long-context
- AI for document processing
- Deep learning for biology
- Inductive biases in deep learning

I previously worked on the [HumBug](https://humbug.ox.ac.uk/) project, which uses deep learning to detect and identify mosquito species by their
flight tone using budget smartphones. I completed my MEng in Engineering Science, specialising in information engineering, at the University of
Oxford, and was supervised by Michael Osborne in my fourth-year project.

In my spare time I enjoy reading, playing D&D, and exploring new pubs, especially those with real ale.
I maintain a table of ratings and useful information about every pub in Oxford [here](/pubs/).
