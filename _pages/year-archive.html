<p>A public diary for me to post each weekday:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What I plan to do today</li>
  <li>What I did yesterday</li>
  <li>Whether I completed yesterday's tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The idea is to mimic the sprint-style daily updates that helped me be more productive during internships this year for my PhD work.
</p>
<p>
  My hope is that this page will serve as an anti-procrastination 
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon">panopticon</a> â€” while certainly no-one will care about the minutiae of my day to day, the fact that someone 
  <em>could</em> be watching will hopefully incentivize me to do the thing properly.
