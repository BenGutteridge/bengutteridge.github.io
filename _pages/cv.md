**Graph Rewiring Project**, *Networks & Society Group, MLRG, Oxford University* (Aug 2022 - Present)
* Continuation of AIMS mini-project supervised by Francesco Di Giovanni, Michael Bronstein and Xiaowen Dong.
* Developing a GNN message-passing framework that allows for adaptive information flow using dynamic rewiring and delayed propagation

**Zero Shot Coordination Project**, *Foerster Lab for AI Research, Oxford University* (Apr 2022 – Aug 2022)
* AIMS mini-project investigating zero-shot coordination for continuous state-action spaces.
* Experimentation with (multi-agent) reinforcement learning algorithms in accelerated physics engine, using Jax/Flax.

**HumBug Project**, *Machine Learning Research Group, Oxford University* (Jun 2020 – Sep 2021)
* Summer research placements supervised by Prof. Stephen Roberts.
* Project concerns the use of low-cost smartphones and audio data analysis for the identification and tracking of mosquito species, for malaria prevention.
* Working on codebase and obtaining experimental results for Bayesian NN species classification for [HumBugDB paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07607), accepted at NeurIPS 2021.
* Worked on testing neural network mosquito classifier, and building/testing voice activity detector for removal of human speech from recordings (2020).

**Final Year Undergraduate Project**, *Bayesian Exploration Lab, Oxford University* (Sep 2020 – June 2021)
* MEng Masters project supervised by Prof. Michael Osborne (project report pdf available [here](../files/Gutteridge_4YP.pdf)).
* Investigating the use of single-sample gradient estimators of evidence lower bound for variational inference, working with Edward Wagstaff.


## Work experience

* Led a team of ten in conducting a COVID-19 medical image deep learning project.
* Also served as Director of Partnerships (Aug 2019 – Jul 2020).

**STEP UP Ambassador**, *New College Oxford Access & Outreach Dept. (Nov 2017 – Jun 2020)
* Ambassador to visiting state schools, leading tours and assisting with annotation of admissions tests.

## Skills
---
* **Python**: experienced across a range of personal and academic projects, with data science (NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, etc.) and deep learning libraries (PyTorch, Jax/Flax).
* **MATLAB**: experience working with during QinetiQ internships and for and undergraduate projects.
* Grade 8 Jazz Clarinet with Distinction, Trinity College London (2016).
