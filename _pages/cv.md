* Ongoing research in collaboration with Francesco Di Giovanni, Michael Bronstein and Xiaowen Dong.
* Developed a GNN message-passing framework that allows for adaptive information flow using dynamic rewiring and delayed propagation. First-author paper, "[DRew: Dynamically Rewired Message Passing with Delay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08018)", accepted to ICML 2023.

**Zero Shot Coordination Project**, *Foerster Lab for AI Research, Oxford University* (Apr 2022 – Aug 2022)
* AIMS mini-project investigating zero-shot coordination for continuous state-action spaces.
* Experimentation with (multi-agent) reinforcement learning algorithms in accelerated physics engine, using Jax/Flax.

**HumBug Project**, *Machine Learning Research Group, Oxford University* (Jun 2020 – Sep 2021)
* Summer research placements supervised by Prof. Stephen Roberts.
* Project concerns the use of low-cost smartphones and audio data analysis for the identification and tracking of mosquito species, for malaria prevention.
* Working on codebase and obtaining experimental results for Bayesian NN species classification for [HumBugDB paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07607), accepted to NeurIPS 2021.
* Worked on testing neural network mosquito classifier, and building/testing voice activity detector for removal of human speech from recordings (2020).

**Final Year Undergraduate Project**, *Bayesian Exploration Lab, Oxford University* (Sep 2020 – June 2021)
