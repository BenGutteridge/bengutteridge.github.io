# Best Books of 2024
![2024 books pie chart](images/books_2024_pie_chart.png)
I read 75 books in 2024, by far my most ever, so I thought I'd do a quick roundup of my top 5 fiction and non-fiction.

In no particular order:

### Fiction
***Great Expectations* (1861) by Charles Dickens**
*"Her contempt for me was so strong, that it became infectious, and I caught it."*
My first proper Dickens. Funny and tragic, great characters, witty, richly thematic, idealistic but grounded. 

***It* (1986) by Stephen King**
While King's prose is sometimes excrutiatingly waffling, it does have a certain conversational, folksy charm which suits the audiobook format especially well. The story is truly epic in its scope and themes: childhood, memory, fear, friendship, etc etc. Laid out the blueprint for the now-classic supernatural coming-of-age tale.

***Watership Down* (1972) by Richard Adams**
*"All the world will be your enemy... be cunning and full of tricks and your people shall never be destroyed."*
I expected *Wind in the Willows*; I got *Lord of the Rings* with rabbits. Adams crafts a convincing lapine language and mythology around El-ahrairah, the 'Prince with a Thousand Enemies' which nicely complements the epic saga of a band of outcast rabbits searching for, establishing, and defending a new home. 

***Shadowdark RPG* (2023) by Kelsey Dionne**
Tenuously a 'non-fiction' book, but I have to give credit to this masterclass in RPG writing: simple but clever rules that utilise common sense and leave ample room for flexibility; a succinct but thematic writing style that respects the GM/player's time; heavily stylised, old-school art and formatting. You could run great TTRPGs sessions for decades using only this book as a resource and never run out of inspiration. The best of modern D&D and old-school renaissance together in one beautifully made A5 book.

***Wuthering Heights* (1847) by Emily Bronte**
*"I have no pity! I have no pity! The more the worms writhe, the more I yearn to crush out their entrails!"*
One of the best books I've ever read. So evocative and cinematic. I keep thinking of the word *pagan*, from this review in the preface:
| “Too odiously and abominably pagan to be palatable even to the most vitiated class of English readers”
I cannot imagine a more compelling endorsement for a book.
