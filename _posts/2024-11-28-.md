### Yesterday
- Worked a little on Lyapunov but mostly cleaning up HTR code and notebooks all day
- Messaged T

### TODO
- NSG group meeting
- Meeting with A and possibly S/J
- HTR
  - Properly figure out what's going on with outliers and whether you can fix them with simple rules
  - Repo big merge: 
    - preprocessing per-dataset, 
    - a single experiment running notebook, and 
    - separate postprocessing repos per table/results analysis
      - Have 'big table' 'drop page table' ready to go EoD
  - Try WER and ANLS*; see if they're reasonable
  - Craft prompts R3 and run them overnight (use batch mode)
