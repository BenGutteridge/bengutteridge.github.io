### Yesterday
- Worked on PR for RT in Lyapunov

### TODO
- ~~Get LR initial func exp running --- for now, pick something sort of reasonable. Standardized argmax of one-hot + Gaussian random, but set it to use only synthetic for now~~
- LR papers quick-read and notes into Notion
- Make updates on Lyapunov if A reviews
  - Do a proper run for delay v non-delay and get eigs
- ~~If time, quick exp for HTR using GPT-chosen page rather than 0th~~
