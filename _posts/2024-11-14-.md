    - Decide if you're going to shoot for the doc workshop (for the first part of this project anyway) in a week's time
    - Decide if you're going to involve T/QC
    - Decide on additional exps for the coming weeks
  - **LR**
    - Exps, figure out why not training properly
    - Push for a meeting w/ F (etc.) and sketch out what experiments, writeup elements we will want for it
