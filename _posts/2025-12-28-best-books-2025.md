![2025 books pie chart](/images/books-2025-pie.png)
Continuing the tradition from [last year](/_posts/2024-12-31-best-books-2024), here is the round-up of the 76 books I read in 2025 (one more than last year, just), what kinds of books they were, how I read them, and brief reviews of some of my favourites. The goal for next year: read my height. 

As ever, please [befriend me on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/friend/i?feature=friend-invite-url&invite_token=ODc5ZjdhYzgtOGZkNy00MDQ2LTgzZmEtODlmYTcyZDEzMzRj) 🙏


In no particular order:

## Fiction

***American Pastoral* (1997) by Philip Roth**

While reading this I found myself frustrated more than a few times: at Roth's ferociously overwritten prose style, rambling tangents, seemingly reactionary politics, and misogyny — he is trying *so hard* to write The Great American Novel — but he may well have succeeded. Roth's hero, the Swede, hidden behind two layers of unreliable narrator, feels so real, is so empathetically drawn, so complete, a great beneficiary and victim of The American Dream that deserves to stand alongside the Willy Lomaxes and Jim Caseys. 

For me, the frustrations and perfections of AP are brilliantly summed up by Richard Ford, writing after Roth's death:

> "*The fusing powers of Roth's imagination, conviction and raging intelligence are everywhere evident and exhilarating. There is about it a profound and heartening sense (and it is a profound book) that the verbal construction you're undertaking as a reader represents absolutely the only way this mighty story could ever be brought into existence. *American Pastoral* stares back at me audaciously unblinking as a great novel. And although such a rambunctious piece of artifice can inevitably not be perfect, it is nonetheless in all its ways right.*"

***Perfection* (2022) by Vincenzo Latronico**

An incisive little book that subjects cynical, insecure, commodified, self-involved, desperate, slightly pathetic Millennial (and elder Gen Z) yuppie life to uncomfortable scrutiny. Hit a little too close to home. Good stuff.

***Rebecca* (1938) by Daphne du Maurier**

All the suspense of gothic horror without a hint of the supernatural. The narrator is extremely relatable as an insecure young woman that slowly finds her voice, but never truly steps out of Rebecca's looming, ever-morphing shadow.

***The Tartar Steppe* (1940) by Dino Buzzati**

An incredible book, somehow both mysterious and completely unsubtle. A feature-length spiritual predecessor to Pink Floyd's *Time* that will freak you the fuck out and make you resolve to finally do That One Thing that will change your life for the better. Maybe next month.

> "That very night time began to slip by him beyond recall... The sun shines high in the sky and it seems to have no wish to set. But at a certain point we turn round, almost instinctively, and see that a gate has been bolted behind us, barring our way back."

Chilling stuff.

***War and Peace* (1869) by Leo Tolstoy**

I’m sure I will think about this for the rest of my life. It’s a slog at times, particularly some of the *War* segments, and the unbearably didactic Epilogue Part II (way to stick the landing Leo), but there is just so much in this book to love and in which to find yourself. To read *War & Peace* is to feel Tolstoy reaching across the centuries and grasping your hand and saying “I see you, we are both human. I have looked around and thought hard, and this is everything I see and understand about humanity put to paper.” 

It’s been said of Ulysses that “all of life is contained within its pages”. I haven’t read it, but I’d be willing to bet that *War & Peace* fits the description better.


## Non-fiction

***Pour Me* (2015) by A.A Gill**

Gill's concise, romantic memoir of alcoholism and becoming a writer after failing as an artist is an arrogant, acerbic barrage of non-stop solid gold absolute fucking bangers. A strong contender for the best memoir I have ever read.

***How Migration Really Works* (2023) by Hein de Haas**

This should be required reading. 22 myths (both left- and right-wing darlings!) about migration debunked. It's infuriating that Starmer and every other world leader either knows the contents of this book already and is ignoring it to serve political aims, or is wilfully ignorant of the facts.

I’d say the main takeaways are these:
- The impacts of migration, positive or negative, are almost always very small
- Big business is pro-migration as it makes them (slightly) richer. Meanwhile, governments pass legislation that benefits big business at the expense of workers, while turning workers against one another by blaming migrants for these problems.
- Anti-migration legislation *increases* net migration: it does little to stop people coming in, and actively encourages them to get in 'before it's too late', while preventing them from leaving again.

***Blackshirts and Reds* (1997) by Michael Parenti**

A slim (~170-odd page), iconoclastic grenade of a book that will challenge your Western liberal consensus ideas of 20th-century communist movements. B&R can feel so bombastic and bitter at times that you will find yourself recoiling at some of the claims. Much like for ‘actually existing’ socialism itself, don’t let the fact that this book isn’t perfect let you dismiss it in favour of an deeply flawed capitalist system/story that feels inevitable (i.e. Fisher's [capitalist realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalist_Realism))

***Technofeudalism: What Killed Capitalism* (2023) by Yanis Varoufakis**

Ambitious to the point of perhaps over-reaching slightly, but excellent. Explains clearly, and makes a compelling case against, big tech's ability to exploit free labour from its users. Makes a compelling case that our economic system has shifted away from products in competition to monopolies parasitically extracting rent from both physical assets and a carved-up digital commons. Clearly and fascinatingly explains the emergence of big tech monopolies directly from post-2008 low interest rates. (Varoufakis' frequent refrain, "socialism for bankers, austerity for everyone else" is funny, tendentious, and basically fair.) His vision of a universal basic dividend and anarcho-syndicalist markets-without-capitalism paints a pretty picture of a utopia of democratised companies and small-scale publically-owned algorithms. The best of Varoufakis I have read; go for this over *Another Now*.

***Doppelganger: A Trip into the Mirror World* (2024) by Naomi Klein**

An impressive piece of memoir meets cultural-political-economic analysis. Klein covers a lot of ground — conspiracy theories, diagonalism, inequality, autism, climate change, COVID, Israel — and largely succeeds in making it all hang together coherently, and around a compelling analogy, no less — that of the doppelganger. We've got an exploration of personal branding (the commodification of the self) as one alienating form of doppelganging, the language and fronts of the left being aped by right-wing conspiracists as another, the healthy self and its exhortation by borderline eugenicist 'wellness' hucksters as another, settler colonial nations as doppelgangers of their progenitors, the "changeling" mythology of autistic children... it goes on and on. A more comprehensive, probably all-in-all better *Minority Rule*, and a potent leftist gateway drug.


**Honourable mentions:** two excellent general (i.e. mainly political) histories I read this year, of the United States and postwar Britain respectively, were ***These Truths* (2018)** by Jill Lepore, and ***A History of Modern Britain* (2007)** by Andrew Marr.
